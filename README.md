# Temporality and Labor
This is a hypertext garden containing art, scholarly articles, and personal observations about the intersection of time and labor. This work was made by Jo Suk in Twine and shown at the ITP Spring 2023 Showcase as part of a group exhibit with the Reverse Engineering class, taught by Sara Raza. This work also served as a guiding example in Jo's How to Build a Hypertext Garden workshop, hosted by NYU Digital Humanities in April 2023.
